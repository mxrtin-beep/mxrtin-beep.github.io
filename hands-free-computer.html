		Computers used to be used without a mouse. Then, Xerox created a little tool you can use to navigate a computer. Then, Apple took the next step with FingerWorks, and created the Trackpad and iPhone, which allowed you to fluidly glide your finger over smooth glass and metal.
	</p>

	<p>
		The next logical step is getting rid of the metal and glass entirely. What is smoother than air?

		This project will allow you to control a computer with nothing other than your webcame and hand. It uses the OpenCV (cv2) package to utilize your webcam and capture each frame. Then, Google's mediapipe locates 20 points on your hand; we use just the fingertips. Finally, the program uses pyautogui to give commands to your mouse and keyboard.
